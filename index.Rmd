## Motivation:

- large regional inequality between Colombian municipalities and high homicide rates.
--

- There is no certainty over the effect of conditional transfers on violent crime, and especially on homicides. 
--

- Scarce academic literature on the impact of CCT programs on crime at the municipal level in Colombia.
--


## Research Objective:

- Which are determinants of homicide rates for Colombian municipalities?

- **To what extent the coverage of  conditional cash transfer program in Colombia (the pacific region of Colombia) may affect homicide rates?**. 

--

  
## Methods:

- Bayesian Model Averaging  **BMA** (Fernandez et al. (2001)).
--

- Synthetic control methods (Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003)).
--


## Data:

- Municipal panel dataset CEDE, released by the University of The Andes. 
--

- National Administrative Department of Statistics. 
--

class: middle, highlight-last-item

## Main Results:


-  15 variables are found to be important determinants of homicide levels. They are related to **crime, inequality, drug-trafficking, conflict and literacy**.

--

- The importance of spatial effects is highlighted by the fact that out of 15 variables **9 are spatially lagged variables**.

--

- It was reported that by 2018, **the average homicide rates were lower for high CCTs coverage municipalities** when compared to synthetic controls  ("copies" made out of a pool of low CCT coverage municipalities).

### Bayesian Model Averaging BMA - methods and results:

$$y=\alpha_{i}+X_{i} \beta_{i}+\varepsilon, \quad \varepsilon \sim N\left(0, \sigma^{2} I\right)$$ 
--

- **how can researchers select just a handful of determinants?** 
--

- **how to evaluate the importance of the inclusion of specific determinants in the model?**
--

- Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) methods attempt to overcome these problems by estimating linear models for all (**MANY**) possible combinations of determinants $X_{i}$

### In terms of crime

The weights are found so that the synthetic municipality has a similar crime trend compared to the treatment municipality (2003-2011) and similar determinants of crime.

- If the time of treatment is changed the effect becomes **consistently not significant**.

- For instance, the p-values become larger than 0.1 if the treatment is assigned in **2008, 2006 or 2004**.

### Concluding Remarks

- Supporting previous studies, variables related to **inequality, literacy rates, previous crime levels, institutional capabilities, conflict and drug-trafficking**  were reported as significant determinants of homicide rates.
--

- By 2018, **the average homicide rates were lower for high CCT coverage municipalities** when compared to synthetic copies made out of a pool of low CCT coverage municipalities.
--


### Implications

- CCT programs appear to be comprehensive policies as they can tackle multiple issues such as **poverty, low education outcomes and violence**.
--

- Given funding constraints, it seems that investing in the expansion of this policy in the Pacific region can be an effective ways to improve developmental outcomes in several areas.
--

- The framework of this paper can be considered a **data science framework to test the impact of regional policies**

$$BMA \rightarrow  \space determinants \space  of\space Y \rightarrow  Synethetic \space Controls \rightarrow The \space impact \space of \space  X \space on \space Y  $$

### Further research


- A dataset of determinants of crime based on previous literature (instead of the determinants found with the BMA) can be assembled.  **This new dataset can be used as the input for the synthetic control analysis.**
--

- **How can we integrate spatial effects and Synthetic Controls?**
Spatial filtering? 
Adding a distance indicator as one of the determinants in the Synthetic Controls framework?

# OPEN SCIENCE

##"The current state of Science in terms of transparency and openness is prompting for action... the term “reproducibility” is also gaining traction.. its definition alludes to the need of scientific results to be accompanied by enough information and detail so they could be repeated by a third party" (Rey et al. 2021)
