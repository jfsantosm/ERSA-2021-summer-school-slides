## Motivation:

- large regional inequality between Colombian municipalities and high homicide rates.
--

- There is no certainty over the effect of conditional transfers on violent crime, and especially on homicides. 
--

- Scarce academic literature on the impact of CCT programs on crime at the municipal level in Colombia.
--


## Research Objective:

- Which are determinants of homicide rates for Colombian municipalities?

- **To what extent the coverage of  conditional cash transfer program in Colombia (the pacific region of Colombia) may affect homicide rates?**. 

--

  
## Methods:

- Bayesian Model Averaging  **BMA** (Fernandez et al. (2001)).
--

- Synthetic control methods (Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003)).
--


## Data:

- Municipal panel dataset CEDE, released by the University of The Andes. 
--

- National Administrative Department of Statistics. 
--

---

class: middle, highlight-last-item

## Main Results:


-  15 variables are found to be important determinants of homicide levels. They are related to **crime, inequality, drug-trafficking, conflict and literacy**.

--

- The importance of spatial effects is highlighted by the fact that out of 15 variables **9 are spatially lagged variables**.

--

- It was reported that by 2018, **the average homicide rates were lower for high CCTs coverage municipalities** when compared to synthetic controls  ("copies" made out of a pool of low CCT coverage municipalities).

### Bayesian Model Averaging BMA - methods and results:

$$y=\alpha_{i}+X_{i} \beta_{i}+\varepsilon, \quad \varepsilon \sim N\left(0, \sigma^{2} I\right)$$ 
--

- **how can researchers select just a handful of determinants?** 
--

- **how to evaluate the importance of the inclusion of specific determinants in the model?**
--

- Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) methods attempt to overcome these problems by estimating linear models for all (**MANY**) possible combinations of determinants $X_{i}$

### In terms of crime

The weights are found so that the synthetic municipality has a similar crime trend compared to the treatment municipality (2003-2011) and similar determinants of crime.

### Concluding Remarks

- Supporting previous studies, variables related to **inequality, literacy rates, previous crime levels, institutional capabilities, conflict and drug-trafficking**  were reported as significant determinants of homicide rates.
--

- By 2018, **the average homicide rates were lower for high CCT coverage municipalities** when compared to synthetic copies made out of a pool of low CCT coverage municipalities.
--


### Implications

- CCT programs appear to be comprehensive policies as thez can tackle multiple issues such as **poverty, low education outcomes and violence**.
--

- Given funding constraints, it seems that investing in the expansion of this policy in the Pacific region can be an effective ways to improve developmental outcomes in several areas.
--

- The framework of this paper can be considered a **data science framework to test the impact of regional policies**

$$BMA \rightarrow  \space determinants \space  of\space Y \rightarrow  Synethetic \space Controls \rightarrow The \space impact \space of \space  X \space on \space Y  $$

### Further research

- The robustness of the result can be tested by changing the thresholds for low and high CCT coverage.  Instead of 30%  and 70%, one can use thresholds such as **20%-80% and 25%-75%**.
--


- A dataset of determinants of crime based on previous literature (instead of the determinants found with the BMA) can be assembled.  **This new dataset can be used as the input for the synthetic control analysis.**
--

- **How can we integrate spatial effects and Synthetic Controls?**
Spatial filtering? 
Adding a distance indicator as one of the determinants in the Synthetic Controls framework?
